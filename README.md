## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

â€™m Lathigaaâ€”driven by curiosity, fueled by purpose, and focused on evolving through impactful experiences that shape both personal and professional growth.

My professional journey didnâ€™t begin with a grand plan, but with a curiosity for how things workâ€”how ideas become products, how people collaborate, and how structure enables scale. Over time, that curiosity evolved into a deep appreciation for systems thinking, user-centric design, and outcome-driven work.

Purpose and contentment go hand in hand, and I believe the right environment fosters both.
Iâ€™m focused on finding spaces where I can contribute, grow, and thrive alongside like-minded individuals.

What I bring is not just skill, but intent. Iâ€™m not here to chase noiseâ€”Iâ€™m here to create value.
